  "topics": {
    "Attack Layers": "The majority of the weapons can target anything; this doesn't mean that they are effective at it.",
    "Comsplosions": "Commander explosions one shot nearby commanders. You have been warned.",
	  "Sonar": "Submarines require sonar in order to be detected. Some naval units have sonar, but sonar structures have the longest range.",
    "Storage": "Storage is non-buildable by commanders. All factories and resource production structures increase storage slightly.",
	"Lobber": "Long-range MLA Boom launcher.",
	"Why can't I Halley": "It takes seven Halleys per standard engine requirements for MLA (They're significantly cheaper though). Legion Engines work as normal, however.",
	"Blue laser of death": "Multiple units fire some variation of a Blue laser of Death, or BLoD. These weapons have long range and high damage, but cost energy to fire and have long reload times. Swarm them with weak units.",
    "Alt-Fire": "Commander alt-fire depends on weapon. Uber Cannon alt-fire fires a barrage of AoE shots. Uber Missile alt-fire fires long-range missiles. Uber Laser alt-fire fires an extremely powerful laser that one-shots anything it hits.",
    "Why don't I have any metal?!": "Reclaiming wreckage is a useful action in this mod and has been facilitated with high HP combat fabbers that excel in this role.",
	"Why don't I have any energy?!": "Although more energy is required in this mod than in vanilla, it's also much, much cheaper. Just build more of it. T2 energy is particularly effective, though volatile.",
    "Wreckage": "A balancing factor. A successful defense means that your opponent gave you a ton of metal",
